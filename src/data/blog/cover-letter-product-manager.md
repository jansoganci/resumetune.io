## Sample Product Manager cover letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a Product Manager passionate about building products that solve real user problems while driving business growth. At StartupXYZ, I led the development of our mobile app's onboarding flow, which increased user activation by 35% and reduced churn by 20% in the first month.

I excel at translating user insights into product strategy. Through user interviews, analytics, and A/B testing, I identified that our signup process was too complex. I worked closely with design and engineering to create a streamlined 3-step flow, resulting in a 40% increase in completed registrations.

My approach combines user empathy with business acumen. I've managed products from concept to launch, working with cross-functional teams of 8-12 people. I'm comfortable with agile methodologies, product analytics tools, and have experience with both B2B and B2C products.

What excites me about your Product Manager role is the opportunity to work on [specific product/feature]. I've been following your company's growth and am impressed by your approach to [specific aspect of their product strategy].

In my first 90 days, I'd focus on understanding your users, analyzing current product metrics, and identifying opportunities to improve user experience and business outcomes.

I'd love to discuss how my product management experience and user-centric approach can contribute to your team's success.

Best regards,
Your Name
