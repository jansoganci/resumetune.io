I specialize in multi-channel marketing campaigns that combine creativity with analytics. My recent campaign for our SaaS product generated 2,500 qualified leads and $500K in pipeline revenue. I've built and managed teams of 5-8 people, working closely with sales, product, and design teams to ensure consistent messaging and brand experience.

My approach balances strategic thinking with hands-on execution. I'm experienced with marketing automation platforms, analytics tools, and have managed budgets up to $200K monthly. I've also led brand repositioning initiatives that improved brand awareness by 60% and customer engagement by 35%.
