I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about building products that users love. At TechCorp, I led the migration of our legacy PHP monolith to a modern React/Node.js architecture, reducing page load times by 40% and improving developer productivity by 60%.

I specialize in React, TypeScript, and Node.js, with experience in AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. I've built scalable APIs serving 100K+ daily users and implemented automated testing that reduced production bugs by 50%. I'm also comfortable with Python for data processing and have contributed to open-source projects with 500+ GitHub stars.

What excites me about your role is the opportunity to work on [specific product/feature they mentioned]. I've been following your company's growth and am impressed by your approach to [specific aspect of their business/technology].

In my first 90 days, I'd focus on understanding your codebase, contributing to your current sprint goals, and identifying opportunities to improve performance or developer experience.
