3. 3 target markets (e.g., US, Japan, South Korea)
4. 3-5 competitor apps

## Analysis Framework

Execute this sequence:

### 1. Market Prioritization

Rank the 3 target markets by:
- App Store revenue potential
- iOS market share
- Competition level

Provide clear recommendation on which market to launch first.

### 2. ASO Strategy (Per Market)

For each target market:

**Generate 15-20 keyword candidates using:**
- Feature-based keywords
- Benefit-based keywords
- Problem-solving keywords
- Competitor keyword analysis

**Recommend optimal metadata:**
- **App Name (30 chars):** Brand + Primary Keyword
- **Subtitle (30 chars):** Value prop + Secondary Keyword
- **Keyword Field (100 chars):** Comma-separated, no spaces
- **Screenshot messaging strategy** (first 3 screenshots only)

### 3. Viral Content Playbook

Generate 10 TikTok/Reels hook ideas using:

1. **Pattern Interruption:** "Stop scrolling if you [pain]..."
2. **Before/After:** Show transformation
3. **Behind-the-Scenes:** "Building [feature] in real-time"
4. **Surprising Use Case:** "This app can do [unexpected thing]"
5. **Tutorial Marketing:** "How to [solve problem] in 30 seconds"

Each hook should be 1-2 sentences max, ready to use.

### 4. Guerrilla Tactics Roadmap

Provide platform-specific tactics:

**Reddit:**
- Top 3-5 relevant subreddits
- Posting strategy (headline formula)
- Engagement rules (90/10 rule)

**Product Hunt:**
- Launch timing recommendation
- Supporter list building strategy
- First-hour momentum tactics

**Micro-Influencer:**
- Target influencer size (nano vs micro)
- Outreach template
- Compensation model (product seeding vs affiliate)

### 5. Localization Matrix

For each target market, specify:
- Messaging tone (formal/casual, direct/indirect)
- Cultural considerations (visual preferences, seasonal imagery)
- Translation requirements (native speaker essential? machine OK?)
- Key differences from US market

### 6. 7-Week Action Plan

Week-by-week roadmap:

- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundation (Reddit karma, ASO research)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Community & content (Discord, screenshot design, influencer outreach)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Launch prep (Product Hunt assets, supporter list)
- **Week 7+:** Launch execution

Each week should have 3-5 specific, actionable tasks.

4. Reference case studies when relevant (Formula Bot, Tally, Code Guide)
5. Be specific and actionable — no vague advice
