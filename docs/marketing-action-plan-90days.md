9. **YouTube** (long-form) - High effort, slow growth
10. **Podcasts** (guest) - Brand awareness, slow conversion
11. **PR/Media** - Lottery ticket, unpredictable
12. **Paid ads** - Only if CAC < LTV proven

### DON'T DO (Waste of Time)
❌ Cold email outreach (low conversion, hurts reputation)
❌ Facebook groups (low-quality traffic)
❌ Buying followers/engagement (fake growth)
❌ Directory spam (doesn't convert)

### Revenue by Traffic Source (Day 90)

1. **Product Hunt**: 15-20% (one-time spike)

3. **Organic Search**: 20-25% (grows over time)
4. **Viral Content**: 15-20% (unpredictable)
5. **Referrals**: 10-15% (compounds)
6. **Direct**: 5-10% (word-of-mouth)

### Month 1 Mistakes
❌ Chasing every new channel (focus beats variety)
❌ Neglecting existing users (retention > acquisition)

❌ Trying paid ads too early (waste money without data)

### Month 2-3 Mistakes
❌ Stopping what worked in Month 1 (consistency wins)
