    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>resumetune.io</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our website and services (the "Service").

    <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User‑provided content</strong>: Text you paste or upload (e.g., CV/resume, job postings, cover letter prompts) for AI processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and device data</strong>: IP address, user‑agent, approximate location (derived from IP), timestamps, pages viewed, referring URLs, performance metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and advertising data</strong>: Events and identifiers collected via Google Analytics 4 and Google Ads/AdSense (e.g., cookies, ad identifiers, campaign parameters).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent data</strong>: Cookie consent preferences recorded via CookieYes (Consent Mode v2 compatible).</li>
      <li><strong>No financial data</strong>: We do not collect payment information at this stage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>

      <li><strong>Analytics and measurement</strong>: Understand usage patterns and measure conversions and marketing performance via GA4 and Google Ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Serve and optimize ads (e.g., AdSense) with regional consent controls.</li>

      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): Where required for analytics/advertising cookies and personalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): To provide the requested Service (processing your content with AI).</li>

    <h2>5) Cookies and Consent</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>CookieYes</strong> to manage cookie consent and support Google Consent Mode v2. You can update your consent preferences at any time via the consent banner or settings provided by CookieYes.</p>

    <h2>6) AI Processing</h2>
    <p>Your input (CV/resume text, job posting, prompts) may be processed by AI providers (e.g., Google’s Gemini API). We do not use your content to train our own models. We aim to process content in memory and avoid persistent server‑side storage of your text beyond what is necessary to deliver results or ensure security and rate‑limiting.</p>

    <h2>7) Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics 4</strong> (analytics): <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Partner sites</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Ads / AdSense</strong> (advertising & measurement): <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy</a>, <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/resources/ccpa/">CCPA resources</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>CookieYes</strong> (consent management): <a href="https://www.cookieyes.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>AI API providers</strong> (e.g., Google Gemini): <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting & infrastructure</strong> (e.g., Vercel; optional Redis/Upstash): See provider privacy/security pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Data Sharing and International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may share data with the providers above to operate and improve the Service. These providers may process data in the EEA, UK, US, or other countries. Where applicable, we rely on adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), and other safeguards required by law.</p>

    <h2>9) Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User content</strong>: Processed transiently to provide results; not stored server‑side longer than necessary for delivery, security, and abuse prevention.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics/ads data</strong>: Retained per provider defaults/configuration (e.g., GA4 retention as configured).</li>
      <li><strong>Logs</strong>: Security and error logs retained for a limited period (typically up to 30 days) then aggregated or deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10) Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>11) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>12) Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <h3>GDPR/UK GDPR</h3>
    <p>You may have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your personal data, and to data portability. Where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior lawful processing. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
    <h3>CCPA/CPRA (California)</h3>
    <p>California residents may have the right to: (i) know/access categories and specific pieces of personal information collected; (ii) delete personal information (subject to exceptions); (iii) correct inaccurate personal information; (iv) opt‑out of “selling” or “sharing” personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising; and (v) not be discriminated against for exercising rights. We do not sell personal information in the traditional sense. Manage preferences via CookieYes and your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>13) Exercising Your Rights</h2>
    <p>To exercise rights or make a privacy request, contact: <a href="mailto:umursoganci@gmail.com">umursoganci@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.</p>

    <h2>14) Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>Because there is no consistent industry standard, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. Use CookieYes or browser settings to control cookies.</p>

    <h2>15) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above indicates the latest revision. Material changes will be highlighted on this page.</p>
