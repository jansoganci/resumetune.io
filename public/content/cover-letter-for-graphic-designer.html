      <h2>Why a tailored Graphic Designer cover letter matters</h2>
      <p>
        Design lives in constraints. A tailored cover letter shows you understand the brand’s voice, audience, and channels. It proves you can present concepts, accept feedback, and deliver files that production teams love.
      </p>

      <h2>Role‑specific tips for Graphic Designers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tip 1 — Show process, not just polish:</strong> Mention how you move from brief to concept to iteration—mood boards, sketches, wireframes, and final assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip 2 — Speak brand systems:</strong> Explain how you use grids, color, type scales, and components to keep work consistent and fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip 3 — Collaborate in the open:</strong> Reference critiques and cross‑functional reviews that improved outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sample Graphic Designer cover letter</h2>
      <div class="sample">
Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a Graphic Designer who turns brand stories into visuals that perform. At Acme, I partnered with Product and Marketing to refresh our visual language across web, ads, and in‑product surfaces. We clarified hierarchy, refined type, and built a component library that sped up production and kept quality high.

For a launch campaign, I explored three concepts with mood boards and rough comps. We tested them in paid social and picked a direction that lifted CTR by 27%. I created final assets in multiple formats, handed off clean files, and documented usage for the content team.

I’m comfortable presenting work and offering rationale: why a specific type scale, how color supports contrast, and where motion adds clarity. I enjoy feedback, and I document decisions so future work stays consistent.

I’d love to bring this clarity and care to your brand. Thank you for your time—happy to share portfolio pieces and walk through my process.

Sincerely,
Your Name
