    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong><script>document.write(new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10))</script></strong></p>

    <h2>1) Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using <strong>resumetune.io</strong> (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2) About the Service</h2>
    <p>The Service provides AI‑assisted tools for analyzing job postings, optimizing resumes, and generating cover letters. We may update or change features from time to time.</p>
    <p>No account is required at this stage. Certain features may be subject to limits (e.g., daily quotas, rate limits) and may be modified for performance, security, or business reasons.</p>

    <h2>3) No Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>AI‑generated outputs are for informational purposes only and are not professional, legal, or employment advice. You are solely responsible for reviewing, editing, and verifying any outputs before use.</p>

    <h2>4) User Content and License</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You retain ownership of content you submit (e.g., CV/resume text, job postings).</li>
      <li>You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, revocable license to host, process, and transmit your content solely to provide and improve the Service (including security and abuse‑prevention).</li>
      <li>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to submit the content and that your content does not violate applicable laws or third‑party rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful, infringing, defamatory, or discriminatory content.</li>
      <li>Probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service; interfere with or disrupt it.</li>
      <li>Circumvent rate limits, quotas, or security measures; use bots or automated scripts to abuse the Service.</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code or underlying models.</li>
      <li>Misrepresent AI outputs as guaranteed, factual, or certified by third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) AI Output and IP</h2>
    <p>AI outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete and may resemble publicly available content. We do not guarantee the uniqueness or non‑infringement of outputs. You are responsible for your use of outputs, including any edits or distribution.</p>

    <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Except for your content, all materials on the Service—including text, UI elements, logos, and software—are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works except as expressly permitted.</p>

    <h2>8) Third‑Party Services and Ads</h2>
    <p>The Service may include links to or integrations with third‑party services (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Ads/AdSense, AI APIs). Your use of those services is governed by the third party’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party content or practices.</p>

    <h2>9) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR‑FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE (OR OUR PROVIDERS) BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (US$100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

    <h2>11) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the owner (Umur Soganci) from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12) Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or used the Service in a manner that may cause harm, liability, or disruption.</p>

    <h2>13) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the owner is domiciled (currently, the Republic of Türkiye), without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles. Courts located in Türkiye shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue for disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service, except where mandatory consumer protection rules provide otherwise. If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA or UK, you may bring claims in your country of residence to the extent required by law.</p>

    <h2>14) Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Effective date” above indicates the latest revision. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
